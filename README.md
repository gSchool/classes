# Classes

## Introduction

**In JavaScript, _Classes_ (or _Class Constructor Functions_) are functions that return objects, referred to as _instances_ of that class. Class constructor functions promote well organized code as well as code reuse. Class constructor functions are frequenty called with the `new` keyword which facilitates leveraging _prototypal inheritance_ and the _`this`_ mechanism, both which support code reuse.**

It is worth noting here that in the field of Computer Science, _class_ has a formal definition which JavaScript not in fact adhere to. JavaScript programmers use the term out of familiarity with other languages, and because of similar observed behavior within their code. This is done in spite of the fact that in JavaScript they are doing something quite different than in other languages that adhere to the formal definiton.

## Objectives

After completing the reading and exercises in this repo you should be able to:

- Build Objects with Functions
- Share Properties with `__proto__` and `prototype`
- Use the `this` Mechanism to Interact with Instance Specific Properties from Shared Properties
- Create Subclass Constructor Functions
- Refactor Class and Subclass Constructor functions to utilize ES6 `class` syntax
