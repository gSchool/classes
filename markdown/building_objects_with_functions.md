# Building Objects with Functions

## Objectives

After completing this section of the repo you should be able to:

- Create objects with functions
- Pass values for dynamic object creation
- Articulate the desire to share object properties and methods

## Most Simple Object Creation

Objects promote well organized code. Developers use them to encapsulate thematically or functionally interrelated **data** and **behavior**.

:question: What are some real world "objects" that might be well represented as JavaScript objects? These real world objects should have traits (data) and the ability to do things (behavior).

Functions, in the meantime, promote code reuse, and developers use them to execute large sections of code with a single function call. Objects and functions play well together. Consider the following `makeRowan` function which creates and returns an object, representing a person named Rowan:

```javascript
function makeRowan() {
  let rowan = {
    name: 'Rowan',
    age: 0,
    curious: true,

    sleep: function() {
      return 'zzzzzzzzzz';
    }
  };

  return rowan;
}
```

:question: Before continuing be sure you can answer the following questions:

- What type of value does `makeRowan` return?
- Whick properties on this returned value represent data?
- Which properties on this returned value represent behavior?
- In what ways does it make sense that a programmer might wish to group these properties together?
- What benefits are there to using a function to create this returned value?

The `rowan` object is an encapsulation of interrelated data and behavior, and using the `makeRowan` function, a new `rowan` object can be created with a simple function call:

```javascript
const rowan1 = makeRowan();
const rowan2 = makeRowan();
const rowan3 = makeRowan();

rowan1.name; // 'Rowan'
rowan2.age;  // 0
rowan3.sleep() // 'zzzzzzzzzz'
```

:question: What will the following log to the console, given the example code just above?

```javascript
console.log(rowan1 === rowan2);
console.log(rowan1.age === rowan2.age);
console.log(rowan1.sleep === rowan3.sleep);
console.log(rowan1.sleep() === rowan3.sleep());
```

:star: Write a function that creates a JavaScript object with 2 or 3 properties, intended to represent something in the real world. The function you write should *not* define any parameters.

## Passing Values for Dynamic Object Creation

Very frequently, when developers wish to reuse code by calling functions, they want to have the ability to provide specifics about the code when calling the function. The ability to define parameters in function definitions and pass in arguments when calling functions greatly increases the flexibility around code reuse, thereby allowing for a much larger range of possible use cases for a given function.

For example, it is easy to imagine wishing to make objects not only for one single person, as `makeRowan` currently does, but for *any* person. In order to do this, the `makeRowan` function should be refectored such that the body of the function is more *general*, with the specifics for any particular object being passed in as arguments to the function.

```javascript
function makePerson(name, age) {
  let person = {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    curious: true,

    sleep: function() {
      console.log('zzzzzzzzzz');
    }
  };

  return person;
}
```

Now using the `makePerson` function, a new person object can be created with a simple function call, and, by simply providing different arguments, the same function can be reused to create objects representing many different people:

```javascript
let rowan = makePerson('Rowan', 0);
let julian = makePerson('Julian', 2);
let soren = makePerson('Soren', 4);

rowan.name;   // 'Rowan'
julian.age;   // 2
soren.curious // true
```

:question: What does the following log to the console, and why?

```javascript
console.log(julian.sleep === soren.sleep);
```

:question: Before continuing be sure you can answer the following questions:

- What are some specific real world objects that could be thought of more generally?
- What specific information is lost in the generalization?
- What is a different general real world object that could be thought of as a more specific instance?
- What information must be provided to distinguish between the general object and the more specific instance?

:star: Refactor the function to wrote earlier to accept at least one arguments, and to modify at least one property on the returned object based on that passed in value.

## The Desire to Share Object Properties and Methods

:speak_no_evil: Read the following code block out loud, making sure to indicate the use of passed in values.

```javascript
function makePerson(name, age) {
  let person = {
    name: name,
    age: age,
    curious: true

    sleep: function() {
      return 'zzzzzzzzzz';
    }
  };

  return person;
}
```

The object returned by `makePerson` has properties on it that can be divided into two categories:

- Properties that utilize passed in values and therefore, may be different each time `makePerson` is called
- Properties that are exactly the same every time `makePerson` is called

:question: Which properties on the return value of `makePerson` will be exactly the same each time it is called, and which will be different?

It would be potentially poor for performance (and rather inelegant) if the properties (and methods) identical on each returned value needed to be built from scratch every time a constructor function was run, even though the constructor is doing the work of creating them. Here's a *very* convoluted example to make the point:

```javascript
// This function creates a function
function makeLoggerFunction() {
  let loggerFunction = () {
    console.log('I am logger');
  }
  return loggerFunction;
}

// If we want to use `loggerFunction` we can make it with `makeLoggerFunction`
var loggerFunction = makeLoggerFunction();
loggerFunction(); // 'I am logger'

// What if each time we wanted to use `loggerFunction` we had to call `makeLoggerFunction` again!?
var loggerFunction = makeLoggerFunction();
loggerFunction(); // 'I am logger'

var loggerFunction = makeLoggerFunction();
loggerFunction(); // 'I am logger'
```

Obviously, programmers want to define functions as few times as is necessary to promote code reuse, and consequently, save memory. JavaScript provides a mechanism for values (including objects that are returned by functions) to share properties, to which we will now turn our focus.
